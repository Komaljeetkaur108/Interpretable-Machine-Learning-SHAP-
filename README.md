# Interpretable-Machine-Learning-SHAP-
# 🔍 Interpretable Machine Learning (SHAP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **model interpretability** using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).  
The goal was to understand how individual features influence model predictions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Machine learning models often behave like black boxes, making it hard to explain predictions.  
This can reduce trust and usability in real-world systems.

---

## 💡 Solution
I used SHAP to:
- Measure feature importance
- Explain individual predictions
- Visualize how features affect model output

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- SHAP  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Global feature importance plots
- Local explanations for individual predictions
- Clear visual interpretation of model behavior

---

## 👩‍💻 My Role
- Integrated SHAP with trained models  
- Generated explanation plots  
- Interpreted and documented results  

---

## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates the importance of explainable AI and helped me understand how to build more transparent machine learning models.
